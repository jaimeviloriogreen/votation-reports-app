## Requirements
You must have installed on your computer:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/)

If you are in Linux be sure to have installed `libpq-dev`. You can do that with this command:

```Shell
    sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
```
libpq is the C application programmer's interface to PostgreSQL. libpq is a set of library functions that allow client programs to pass queries to the PostgreSQL backend server and to receive the results of these queries.

## Installation

Just run this command:

```Shell
    pipenv install
```
